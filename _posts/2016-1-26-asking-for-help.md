title: Asking For Help
---
  When it comes to asking for help, my method (when thinking clearly and not frustrated) looks something like this:

####1. Realize that something unexpected happened (or nothing happened)

####2. Double-check that the trouble isn't a simple error by checking that all constants are still constant and all variables are proper and accounted for. 
  *Also called the "check to see if it's plugged in" step*

####3. Try once or twice more for good measure
  *Like step 2, this will help determine if the trouble is a simple user error.* 

####4. Isolate the trouble area if possible by removing elements and testing on as small an area as possible.

####5. If small area works properly, move back a step or two by introducing the rest of the mechanism piece-by-piece.
  *The smaller the increment of widening of scope is, the better the prospect of finding exactly what is causing the trouble.*

####6. Once we find the problem area, continue breaking it down until the exact location of the trouble has been found.

####7. If the trouble cannot be found, or the problem is thought to lie outside the scope of one's knowledge or local resources, come up with a question that describes the closest we can get to the problem. 
  *For example, one with no experience in car repair might say, "my car doesn't stop when I stomp on the brake, and I have no idea why" and a weekend do-it-yourselfer might say, "my car doesn't stop when I stomp on the brake and I've checked the brake fluid, bled the lines and regreased the calipers and boots and this issue is somewhere out of my level of expertise" while a mechanic might say, "you've got a bad master cylinder, and it is going to cost you a lot of money, which is fortunate for me because I am saving up for a boat."

####8. Giving a bit of background on the problem and the level to which the problem was tracked, we go to someone with deeper knowledge for help. In the case of OCS, I will ask Sumeet or one of the TAs in a comment on GitHub, an email, or in person while in class.
