1. Use clear, concise lanuguage. (i.e. avoid words and phrases like 'thing', 'shitty', 'it's being stupid', "I hate it")

2. Describe what you are trying to accomplish with a specific piece/block of code.

3. Describe what's actually happening.

4. Note the error messages you're getting in return and attempt to decipher them.

5. Beg for a swift, merciful <del>death.</del>   answer to your question.
