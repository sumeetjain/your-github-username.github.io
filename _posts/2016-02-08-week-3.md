title: OCS Log, Week 3
---

As we forge ahead into week three, spirits are still high in spite of the humbling syntax or NilClass error. It also doesn't hurt that upon crossing the threshold into the school itself, a delightful time warp takes hold, reducing hours of coding to mere minutes.

Aside from finding true enjoyment in utter frustration, there comes that heartening feeling elicited by the groans and squees alike of fellow students. That's the sound of friendships and comraderie being forged as we contort our minds to appease our mechanical overlords.

The pace of class has been demanding yet manageable. Nothing quite like reaching the summit of understanding one concept only to have Sumeet kick that boulder back down the hill. 

At the risk of adolescent Chris rolling in his grave, I am loving the feeling of being back in school and putting learning to the forefront again.
