### "How we're supposed to ask for help with our work"

When asking questions at Omaha Code School, the purpose of asking questions must be understood in order to know "how" to ask them in the first place. 
We do not ask questions simply to "get the answer." Rather, we ask them to better understand how to solve the problem in a way that shows us the bigger picture and how it is to achieve what we're going for in other situations. So, when I ask a question, it is very important that I can demonstrate that I understand what I've done so far, or if I don't that I can specify what step (for instance) that is causing confusion. It is also imperative that I can first break down the steps of what I'm trying to achieve, before I ask what is wrong at the coding level. If I am unsure of what is supposed to happen at the systems-thinking/algorithmic level, then asking what is wrong with the code will not be of much help at all. 

What this means is that if I have a question on the coding level, that I first google, research notes, and obviously carefully debug before I ask Sumeet a question regarding the Code. 
If my question at the algorithmic level, then I must first make sure I can articulate at what point in the algorithm I am getting stuck.
