Wow. Four Weeks! Really? That can't be right! I just checked my calendar and I guess it's true! This means we're a third of the way through our course. Two more months to go. 

I'd say this past week has been the most trying week so far. As I've pointed out previously, I don't really seem to have a difficult time with the concepts or tracking with each new thing we learn. By far, the most difficult part for me is stepping out of my comfort zone and working on building my own creations from scratch. Throughout my life (especially in regards to education), there has been nothing that intimidates me more than a blank page. The same is true with coding. It may not be a blank paper page, but it's still the same obstacle. What am **I** going to chose to do with this assignment? Which direction will I take? How far do I go with all of this?

Those are the kinds of questions (along with hundreds of others) that buzz around in my head like a bunch of angry bees that are desparate to get out and find their hive. Yes. It's still these struggles. They haven't changed since the last time I wrote about them. In fact, if anything, it has gotten more challenging for me. And just when I am about to reach the point of overwhelming frustration, I remember that I chose this. I trusted the approach Sumeet and Omaha Code School claimed to take to help people reach their goal of becoming web developers. I still feel that way. I trust Sumeet and I have never once doubted the direction he has taken us. 

What helps me is keeping in mind that learning in a fashion that is "comfortable" or "easy" isn't **necessarily** what we always need. Sometimes we need to be stretched. Sometimes we need help to break out of our shells and experience things we wouldn't have otherwise experienced. That's how I see my challenges here at code school. They're painful and frustrating now, but they're going to be the difference between merely having a good "grasp" on how web development wortkd and truly knowing that I have what it takes to create things on my own and come overcome obstacles that seem impossible. 

Another comforting thought is that we've learned so much already and we still have two more months to go. I really get excited thinking about how much more we're going to learn in these coming months. I'm already starting to sense that a solid foundation is forming. So with all of the anxiety and "what ifs" that come along with this, there's also an encouraging dose of excitement and confidence growing. Now it's up to me to just make sure I allow the latter to keep me going when the former **tries** to take me down (but don't worry. I won't let it).
