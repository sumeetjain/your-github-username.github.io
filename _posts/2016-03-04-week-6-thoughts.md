title: Half Way There...
---

Now we're talking! It has been six weeks. That means we're halfway through code school. In so many ways, though, it doesn't feel like we're at the halfway point. I mean, I still have so much to learn, right? Yes, but it's not like we haven't learned a lot already. We certainly have. I *think* I can speak for all of the students when I say that we really just take this very seriously. And we want to do well. The thought of being "job ready" in just six more weeks is a bit intimidating. 

This past week was spent "pair programming." It has been, without a doubt, my favorite week thus far. It's not so much the *pairing* part that I liked (though there were many things about pair programming that I really enjoyed (and my partner was great!)), it's more that I enjoyed the project and the excitement that surrounded it.

We were all given the choice of coming up with our own ideas for our programming assignement. Of course, we couldn't do *anything* we wanted. The goal was to create a simple solution for real problems or challenges that we face in our lives, in one way or another. My partner and I chose to make a web application that keeps track of the last time you've contacted a friend or family member *and* reminds you, based on a user-set reminder interval, to contact them if it reached that point. 

I really wish I could take the credit for this idea. I can't though. It was my partner's idea. I guess the only thing I can take credit for was realizing that it was, indeed, a very good idea and that we should go with it (rather than deciding to set it aside and go with a different idea). I recognized right away that this was something that I could use in my own life, especially with those family members (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins) or long-time friends that we often times forget to keep in touch with, even though we'd really like to keep in touch with them. 

Coming up with our own idea was fun. More than that though, it was a pretty thrilling experience to be able to write the code to be able to that happen(which we can totally do now) and to be able to have some freedom as to how it should work and be used.

Now, if you've read any of my other journals, you'll know that perhaps my biggest struggle is my own self-doubt. This assignment was no exception. Forget the fact that we made a working web app with all of the basic functionality that we set out to accomplish. Our application is pretty simple by nature. What this means is that we really didn't need to connect any API's or have our app do any heavy lifting. Some of the other projects from other students really did have some incredible features that required higher level coding concepts (in fact, I was *very* impressed by all of the projects by the time the students presented them). 

So here I am, once again, wondering if I'm cut out for all of this, just because our project wasn't as complex as some of the others. Oh well. I'll get over it. I have to. We've only got six weeks left!
