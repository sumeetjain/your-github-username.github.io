title: Week Five Thoughts
---

Week 5 was the hardest week for me. I can say this with certainty because I had an actual breakdown last Tuesday (or was it Monday? I've lost track of time!). I did. I broke down. I will admit it. Looking back, I think the reason I broke down was pretty silly. Let me tell you about it.

It was around 7pm on a Tuesday (or Monday) and I had just come home from a long day of coding and took a break to eat some lunch and do some things around the apartment (and maybe have some quality time with our baby girl). I should add here that my brain *typically* shuts down between 7 and 8 on most nights (depending on my caffeine consumption for the day. Also, I do my best work in the morning). So here I was, getting ready to get back into some serious coding and it was after 7pm. Normally I would've stopped for the day, but I still had several hours of work to do. At this point, I should've just worked on as much as I possibly could and just called it a night when I could no longer function. 

Instead, I made a big mistake. 

I decided to get on to GitHub and see where some of my fellow classmates with their work.  To my utter astonishment, practically everyone was WAY ahead of me. I know this because GitHub shows you not only all of the code that has been completed, it also shows you what *time* the code was submitted. I had to do a few double-takes. Coudl this be right? I checked a few other students code. They had also finished their assignment for the day and had done so several hours earlier. 

I felt terrible. Immediately, I tried to start working as hard and fast as I could, but my brain wasn't having it. It was near 8pm by this point and my brain had made up its mind that it was done thinking for the day. I kept trying though. As I looked at my screen, all of the code that had made perfect sense that day, started to swirl around into a whirlwind of nonsense that might as well have been Klingon. This is where the panic set in. I felt like there was something wrong with me. Then I broke down.

Turns out, I was probably just tired and emotional. On top of all this, I haven't even mentioned that in addition to having a 4 1/2 month baby girl, my wife and I also live in an apartment for people with developmental disabilities, where we both (up until code school started) acted as residental managers. Now my wife stays home with our daughter AND stays at the apartment 24/7 to continue acting as the residental manager. We love the job and we love the residents. But there can be lots of drama on any given day. This was any given day. But even worse. And Elliana (our daughter) was especially fussy that night. So my wife had just broke down an hour or so before I finally lost it.

Now that it's all behind us, I can tell you that I got worked up over pretty much nothing. In fact, I was being unfair on myself. I realize now that earlier that day (Monday or Tuesday... it doesn't matter) the lecture had gotten done fairly early (10:30ish) and most people started working on their assignment *immediately* afterwards. Not only did I *not* start right away, I actually got held up with some stomach issues, and then when I finally got set up at the coffee shop I always go to, I saw an old friend and chatted with him for a while. I also ate lunch (and I don't always like to code while I eat). By the time I got started, it was probably 1:30pm. Since it had been 3 hours since the lecture, I had forgotten a few things and went back and watched the lecture videos on line!

Anyway, the point of all this is that I really wasn't fair on myself. I got a late start to my day and even went home earlier than I usually do. So already being behind combined with all the drama at home created a perfect storm and it was only a matter of time before it got the best of me.

Needless to say, I'm all better now. But I've learned my lesson. Stay on task. And don't worry about where everyone else is.

That is all.
